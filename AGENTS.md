# AGENTS.md — Guidance for AI Coding Assistants

This file gives AI coding tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot,
etc.) the context and operating rules they need to make safe, high-quality
contributions to the ReEDS repository. Human contributors should also feel free
to read it.

If anything in this file conflicts with
[`docs/source/developer_best_practices.md`](docs/source/developer_best_practices.md)
or with explicit user instructions, the developer best practices document and
the user win.

**This file is meant to grow.** If you (human or AI) discover a recurring
gotcha, a useful workflow, a switch interaction that's easy to miss, or any
other piece of guidance that would have saved time on a previous task, add
it here. Keep additions concise and verify them against the current repo
before committing.

## 1. What ReEDS is (and why it matters for AI assistants)

ReEDS (Regional Energy Deployment System) is the National Laboratory of the
Rockies (NLR) long-term capacity-expansion and dispatch model for the U.S.
electricity system. It is:

- **Large.** Hundreds of input files, hundreds of switches in `cases.csv`, and
  many GAMS, Python, and Julia files that interact through a multi-stage
  pipeline.
- **Mixed-language.** GAMS (`*.gms`) defines the optimization model and
  requires a commercial license (CPLEX or compatible); Python 3.11 drives
  preprocessing, orchestration, and postprocessing; Julia 1.12.1
  (`reeds/resource_adequacy/reeds2pras/`) handles resource-adequacy stress-period analysis.
- **Production research software.** Results are used in published studies and
  by external stakeholders. Silent changes to defaults or to widely-used
  switches can invalidate analyses.

**Implication for AI tools:** small, local-looking changes can have
non-obvious downstream effects across switches, scenarios, and postprocessing
scripts. Bias toward minimal, well-scoped edits and toward asking the human
for confirmation when uncertain.

---

## 2. Operating principles (the four rules the user cares about most)

### 2.1 Do not add code beyond what the task requires
- No "while I'm here" refactors, renames, reformatting, or speculative
  abstractions.
- Don't add docstrings, comments, type hints, or error handling to code you
  did not need to touch.
- Prefer the smallest patch that correctly accomplishes the request.
- Before writing a new utility function, check whether one already exists in
  the `reeds/` package (`reeds/io.py`, `reeds/inputs.py`, `reeds/spatial.py`,
  `reeds/techs.py`, `reeds/units.py`, etc.). These modules contain broadly
  reused helpers for reading switches, hierarchies, deflators, maps, and more.
- Don't introduce new dependencies (Python, Julia, or otherwise) without
  explicit approval. Changes to [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) or
  [`Project.toml`](Project.toml) must be called out.

### 2.2 Keep documentation in sync with code
The repo treats documentation as part of the change, not an afterthought. When
your change touches model behavior, switches, inputs, or outputs, update the
relevant file(s) under [`docs/source/`](docs/source):

- [`docs/source/model_documentation.md`](docs/source/model_documentation.md) —
  high-level description of default model behavior. Use admonition blocks for
  developer-only details (switch names, parameter names, file paths in
  backticks).
- [`docs/source/user_guide.md`](docs/source/user_guide.md) — user/developer
  description of switches and input files.
- [`docs/source/faq.md`](docs/source/faq.md) — limitations, caveats, known
  issues.
- [`docs/source/postprocessing_tools.md`](docs/source/postprocessing_tools.md) —
  postprocessing scripts.
- Several `inputs/{subfolder}/README.md` files exist (e.g.,
  [`inputs/sets/README.md`](inputs/sets/README.md),
  [`inputs/plant_characteristics/README.md`](inputs/plant_characteristics/README.md),
  [`inputs/transmission/README.md`](inputs/transmission/README.md),
  [`inputs/zones/README.md`](inputs/zones/README.md), and a handful of others)
  — update them when you change files in those folders. Not every input
  subfolder has a README; do not assume one exists.
- [`docs/source/setup.md`](docs/source/setup.md) — installation/setup changes.

If you add or rename a switch, update both `cases.csv` (description column)
**and** `user_guide.md`. If you add or rename an input file, update
[`reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv`](reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv) and the relevant input-folder README.

Citations live in [`docs/source/references.bib`](docs/source/references.bib)
(Better BibTeX format, managed via the ReEDS Zotero library — see
`developer_best_practices.md` §"Adding Citations in the Documentation"). Do
not hand-edit `.bib` entries unless the user explicitly asks.

When you change a sourced data file, regenerate
[`sources.csv`](sources.csv) and
[`sources_documentation.md`](sources_documentation.md) using the workflow in
[`docs/source/documentation_tools/`](docs/source/documentation_tools)
(see `developer_best_practices.md` §"Documentation Guidelines").

### 2.3 Avoid unintended consequences
ReEDS has many switches in [`cases.csv`](cases.csv) that gate large blocks of
behavior. A change that looks isolated in one `.gms` or `.py` file may
silently affect:

- Other scenarios in [`cases.csv`](cases.csv),
  [`cases_test.csv`](cases_test.csv), [`cases_standardscenarios.csv`](cases_standardscenarios.csv), etc.
- Files declared in [`reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv`](reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv)
  (governs which inputs are copied into a run's `inputs_case/` directory
  and how they are aggregated / disaggregated).
- The objective function (`reeds/core/setup/d_objective.gms`) — inputs used here should
  also appear in [`tests/objective_function_params.yaml`](tests/objective_function_params.yaml)
  so [`reeds/input_processing/check_inputs.py`](reeds/input_processing/check_inputs.py)
  can validate them.
- Reported outputs declared in [`reeds/core/terminus/report_params.csv`](reeds/core/terminus/report_params.csv)
  and assembled in [`reeds/core/terminus/report.gms`](reeds/core/terminus/report.gms). Adding, removing, or
  renaming a reported parameter touches both files plus any downstream
  postprocessing (`postprocessing/`, `compare_cases.py`, BokehPivot, R2X)
  that reads it.
- The resource adequacy module (`reeds/resource_adequacy/`) — runs **between**
  solve years to compute capacity credit and curtailment that feed back into
  the next solve. It is not a postprocessing step; changes here can change
  results.
- Postprocessing reports that depend on parameter names, units, or
  CSV column headers.

Before committing a non-trivial change, mentally (and where reasonable,
actually) check:

1. **Switch coverage.** Does the change behave correctly for every documented
   value of every switch it touches? In particular: `GSw_Region`,
   `GSw_HourlyType`, `GSw_HourlyNumClusters`, `GSw_AnnualCap`, `GSw_H2`,
   `GSw_PRM_CapCredit`, `GSw_Storage`. If a switch defaults to
   off, document the assumption explicitly in the PR.
2. **Default case neutrality.** If the change is *not expected to alter
   results for the default case* (for example, a rename, a reformat, or new
   code that only runs when an off-by-default switch is turned on), say so
   explicitly so the reviewer knows that the comparison report should show
   no differences.
3. **`reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv` consistency.** If you add, remove,
   or rename a CSV file that is read by GAMS, update
   `reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv`. Pay attention to
   `aggfunc`/`disaggfunc`, `region_col`, `fix_cols`, `i_col`, `wide`,
   `header`, `key`, `post_copy`, `GAMStype`, `GAMSname`, and `required_if`
   columns. A wrong `required_if` expression silently breaks switch-gated
   runs (the file is not copied into `inputs_case/` and GAMS later fails
   loading it). Scalar parameters live in
   [`inputs/scalars.csv`](inputs/scalars.csv); add new scalars there rather
   than hard-coding values. New files that get copied to `inputs_case/`
   also need an entry in [`inputs/userinput/futurefiles.csv`](inputs/userinput/futurefiles.csv),
   which tells [`reeds/input_processing/forecast.py`](reeds/input_processing/forecast.py)
   how to project the file forward in time — forecast.py will print a
   loud warning if a file is missing from it.
4. **Units and dollar year.** Costs read into `b_inputs.gms` must already be
   in 2004$. Use `inputs/financials/deflator.csv` in preprocessing scripts
   (do not hard-code conversions). Add unit suffixes to new column names
   (e.g., `capcost_usd.per.kw`).
5. **Tests.** Run `pytest` from the repo root. Note that the `pytest` suite
   in [`tests/`](tests) is lightweight (input checks, h5 read sanity) and
   does **not** validate model behavior — use it as a smoke test, not a
   correctness test. CI runs:
   - [`.github/workflows/python-app.yaml`](.github/workflows/python-app.yaml)
     (pytest + a small case),
   - [`.github/workflows/build-docs.yaml`](.github/workflows/build-docs.yaml),
   - [`.github/workflows/workflow-quality.yaml`](.github/workflows/workflow-quality.yaml)
     (lints GitHub Actions files with `zizmor`).
   PRs need all of these to pass.

The map of change → recommended testing comes straight from
`developer_best_practices.md`:

- **Pure post-processing / cosmetic change:** confirm postprocessing still
  runs against an existing `runs/` output; no model rerun required.
- **Code change not expected to affect default-case results** (e.g., behind
  an off-by-default switch, a rename, or rounding below model tolerance):
  run the Pacific test case (`cases_test.csv`) and produce a comparison
  report.
- **Anything else (the most common floor for non-trivial changes):** run
  `USA_defaults` (or `Mid_Case`) plus `USA_decarb` from `cases_test.csv` and
  produce comparison reports with `postprocessing/compare_cases.py`. Be
  prepared to explain changes in capacity, generation, transmission, bulk
  system price, system cost, and runtime.

AI tools generally cannot run these full scenarios themselves. **State
clearly which tier of testing the change requires** so the human contributor
can run it before opening a PR.

Before (or alongside) recommending one of the tiers above, see
[§6 “Fast inner loop”](#6-fast-inner-loop-iterating-on-a-single-step-from-call_).
Re-running individual steps from a completed run's `call_*` script (`.bat`
on Windows, `.sh` on macOS/Linux) is much faster than a full Pacific run
and lets you catch obvious errors and verify expected diffs early. It does **not** replace the testing tiers
above — it reduces the chance that something unexpected shows up when the
full tests are eventually run.

### 2.4 Ask the human when something is unclear
Stop and ask when:

- The intent of a switch, parameter, or set is ambiguous.
- The same value or behavior could plausibly be controlled in more than one
  place and you can't tell which is canonical.
- A change would alter default-case results, even slightly, and the user did
  not say that was the goal.
- You would need to add a dependency, change `environment.yml` /
  `Project.toml`, modify CI, or touch large data files.
- The fix appears to require modifying inputs hosted in
  [ReEDS_Input_Processing](https://github.com/ReEDS-Model/ReEDS_Input_Processing)
  or on Zenodo rather than (or in addition to) this repo.
- A request seems to conflict with the developer best practices document.

When asking, present 2–3 concrete options and your recommendation rather than
an open-ended question.

## 3. Repository map (the parts you'll touch most often)

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`runreeds.py`](runreeds.py) | Top-level launcher. **Interactive by default** — prompts for a batch name and cases suffix when run with no arguments. AI agents must pass `-b <batch>` and `-c <suffix>` (and typically `-s <case>` and/or `-f`) to avoid hanging. Reads `cases_{suffix}.csv` and creates a `runs/{batch}_{case}/` directory per case. |
| [`cases.csv`](cases.csv), `cases_*.csv` | Switch definitions and scenario specifications. The first columns describe each switch; remaining columns are scenarios. |
| [`reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv`](reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv) | Declares every input/output CSV the run pipeline knows about, including how to aggregate/disaggregate spatially and how it maps to GAMS. Consumed by `copy_files.py` (the first preprocessing step), which copies the listed files from `inputs/` into `inputs_case/`. After `copy_files.py` runs, all subsequent steps — GAMS and Python alike — read exclusively from `inputs_case/` and do not reference `inputs/` in the repo. |
| [`inputs/scalars.csv`](inputs/scalars.csv) | Central registry of GAMS scalar parameters and their default values. |
| [`reeds/core/`](reeds/core) | All GAMS model code, organized into `setup/`, `solve/`, `solve_pcm/`, and `terminus/` subdirectories. |
| [`reeds/core/setup/b_inputs.gms`](reeds/core/setup/b_inputs.gms) | Loads inputs from `inputs_case/` into GAMS sets/parameters. |
| [`reeds/core/setup/a_createmodel.gms`](reeds/core/setup/a_createmodel.gms) | Entry point that `$include`s `b_inputs.gms`, `c_model.gms`, `d_objective.gms`, and `e_solveprep.gms` to compile the model. Re-run this line from `call_*` to surface compilation errors quickly without doing a solve. |
| [`reeds/core/setup/c_model.gms`](reeds/core/setup/c_model.gms), [`reeds/core/setup/d_objective.gms`](reeds/core/setup/d_objective.gms) | Variables, equations, and objective of the optimization model. |
| [`reeds/core/setup/e_solveprep.gms`](reeds/core/setup/e_solveprep.gms) | Pre-solve data preparation; also `$include`d by `a_createmodel.gms`. |
| [`reeds/core/solve/`](reeds/core/solve) | Sequential / intertemporal / window solve loop (`solve.py`, `3_solve_oneyear.gms`, `3_solve_allyears.gms`, `3_solve_window.gms`, `2_financials.gms`, `2_temporal_params.gms`, `4_post_solve_adjustments.gms`, `5_varfix.gms`, `6_data_dump.gms`, `1_tc_phaseout.py`). |
| [`reeds/core/solve_pcm/`](reeds/core/solve_pcm) | Production-cost (PCM) dispatch mode — `solve_pcm.gms` and `unfix_op.gms`. Launched by [`postprocessing/run_pcm.py`](postprocessing/run_pcm.py). |
| [`reeds/core/terminus/`](reeds/core/terminus) | Reporting: `report.gms`, `report_dump.py`, `report_params.csv`, `powfrac_calc.gms`, `dump_alldata.gms`. `report_params.csv` controls which parameters get exported; adding/renaming a parameter also requires updating any downstream postprocessing that reads it. |
| [`reeds/resource_adequacy/`](reeds/resource_adequacy) | Capacity-credit and stress period calculations (`ra_calcs.py`, `capacity_credit.py`, `stress_periods.py`, etc.) that run **between** solve years and feed back into the next solve. Not a postprocessing step — changes here affect results. Includes `reeds2pras/` (Julia, pinned to 1.12.1). |
| [`reeds/input_processing/`](reeds/input_processing) | Python preprocessing — load, hourly clustering, supply curves, financials, copying input files into `inputs_case/`, etc. |
| [`hourlize/`](hourlize) | Hourly load/resource preprocessing pipeline (often run upstream and committed as data). |
| [`postprocessing/`](postprocessing) | Reports, plots, comparison tools (`compare_cases.py`, `compare_dispatch.py`, BokehPivot, Tableau, retail-rate module, reValue, R2X runner, etc.). |
| [`preprocessing/`](preprocessing) | Helpers for preparing scenario sets, transmission cases, Zenodo prep, etc. |
| [`helpers/`](helpers) | Convenience scripts (`runstatus.py`, `restart_runs.py`, `interim_report.py`, etc.) for monitoring and managing runs. |
| [`scripts/`](scripts) | Standalone utility scripts (e.g., `run_r2x.py`). |
| [`inputs/`](inputs) | All input data, organized by topic. Some subfolders have their own `README.md`. |
| [`docs/source/`](docs/source) | Sphinx + MyST-Markdown documentation source. Built by `make html` from `docs/`. |
| [`tests/`](tests) | Lightweight `pytest` suite (input checks, h5 read sanity); see [`tests/conftest.py`](tests/conftest.py), [`tests/test_outputs.py`](tests/test_outputs.py), and [`tests/test_read_h5_files.py`](tests/test_read_h5_files.py). Not a model-correctness suite. |
| [`.github/`](.github) | CI workflows (`python-app.yaml`, `build-docs.yaml`, `workflow-quality.yaml`), the `setup-reeds-env` action, PR template, issue templates. |
| [`reeds/`](reeds) | Importable Python package of shared utilities (`financials`, `inputs`, `io`, `log`, `plots`, `ra`, `spatial`, `techs`, `timeseries`, `units`, `remote`, etc.) plus all core model code. New shared helpers belong here, not duplicated across scripts. |
| [`reeds/hpc/`](reeds/hpc) | HPC (SLURM) and AWS launch templates (`srun_template.sh`, `aws_setup.sh`). HPC vs local execution paths can differ; verify behavior on the target environment. |
| [`reeds/solver/`](reeds/solver) | Solver option files (`cplex.opt`, `cplex.op2`, `gurobi.opt`, `cbc.opt`). |
| [`environment.yml`](environment.yml), [`Project.toml`](Project.toml) | Conda env and Julia project file. Changes to these must be called out explicitly. |

A typical run produces `runs/{batch}_{case}/` containing `inputs_case/`
(all inputs for the run), `g00files/` (GAMS save/restart files), `lstfiles/`
(GAMS listing files), `handoff/` (resource adequacy data passed between solve
years), `autocode/` (auto-generated GAMS code), `outputs/` (results), and
`reeds/` (frozen copy of the source tree used by `call_*`).

## 4. Coding conventions (summary — read `developer_best_practices.md` for the full set)

### Python
- Target Python 3.11; follow PEP 8.
- Use `os.path.join` for paths; do not change the working directory in
  preprocessing scripts; prefer absolute paths.
- Run `ruff check` (linter only — do **not** auto-format existing files).
- Files ≥10 MB should be `.h5`, not `.csv`.
- Column headers should use the ReEDS set names where practical (e.g., `r`,
  `i`, `h`, `t`, `v`).

### GAMS
- File prefix convention: numeric prefix then descriptive name (e.g.,
  [`reeds/core/solve/2_financials.gms`](reeds/core/solve/2_financials.gms),
  [`reeds/core/solve/3_solve_oneyear.gms`](reeds/core/solve/3_solve_oneyear.gms)).
  Files in `reeds/core/setup/` use a letter prefix
  (e.g., `a_createmodel.gms`, `b_inputs.gms`).
- Parameters: lowercase with underscores, noun first, units in declaration
  comment between `--…--` (e.g., `cap_out(i,r,t) "--MW-- capacity by region"`).
- Variables: ALL_CAPS, noun first.
- Equations: prefix `eq_`, lowercase with underscores.
- Switches: `GSw_UpperCamelCase` in `cases.csv`; numeric switches surface as
  `Sw_Foo` scalars inside GAMS. `0` = off, `1` = on.
- Index ordering: `(ortype, i, v, r, h, …, t)` with `t` always last.
- No inline `//` comments. No `$ontext/$offtext` except as file headers.
- Compile-time conditionals must use a `.tag` (e.g., `$ifthen.switch1
  Sw_One==A`).
- See `developer_best_practices.md` for equation formatting (sums on three
  lines, parameters left of variables, etc.).

### Inputs
- Input CSVs read by `b_inputs.gms` should have the **same name** as the GAMS
  parameter that reads them.
- New CSVs written into `inputs_case/` must be registered in
  [`reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv`](reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv) **and** in
  [`inputs/userinput/futurefiles.csv`](inputs/userinput/futurefiles.csv)
  (which controls how the file is projected forward in time by
  `reeds/input_processing/forecast.py`).
- Costs land in `b_inputs.gms` already in 2004$.
- If a new input file contains dollar values, either pre-convert them to 2004$
  in the preprocessing script (using `inputs/financials/deflator.csv` — do not
  hard-code conversions), or record the dollar year in the relevant subfolder's
  `dollaryear.csv`. Some input subfolders (e.g., `plant_characteristics/`,
  `supply_curve/`, `fuelprices/`, `consume/`) maintain a `dollaryear.csv` that
  maps scenario names to dollar years — update that file when adding a
  scenario-based cost file to one of those folders.
- Add a comment in `reeds/core/setup/b_inputs.gms` noting the upstream script
  when a file is generated by preprocessing (e.g., `* Written by writecapdat.py`).
- Add unit suffixes to data column names (e.g., `capcost_usd.per.kw`).

## 5. How to be a good AI collaborator on this repo

A short checklist to apply to every non-trivial change:

1. **Restate the request** in one sentence and confirm scope before editing
   more than ~3 files or ~50 lines.
2. **Read before writing.** Open the file you're about to change and at least
   one caller/consumer of it.
3. **Search for switch interactions.** Grep for any `GSw_*` or `Sw_*` name
   that appears in the file you're editing. Note any switch-gated branches in
   the PR description.
4. **Update `reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv` and docs in the same change**, not as a follow-up.
5. **Summarize impact.** In the PR text or response to the user, list:
   - Files changed and why.
   - Switches/scenarios that could be affected.
   - Whether the default case is expected to change.
   - Recommended test tier (post-process / Pacific / full-US).
   - Any docs updated and any docs the user still needs to update.
6. **Branch and PR hygiene.**
   - Start branches from `main`, not from another feature branch unless
     specified by the user.
   - Keep PRs small and single-topic.
   - Make the PR **title** descriptive and complete — it is reused verbatim
     in the release-notes summary for each ReEDS version.
7. **Disclose AI usage — required.** The PR template has a section
   ("Did you use LLM tools (chatbot or copilot) in the preparation of this
   PR? If so, describe how") that must be filled in. The PR author is
   responsible for understanding and being able to defend every change,
   regardless of how it was generated.
8. **Never** force-push, rewrite published history, modify CI secrets, run
   destructive `git` commands, or commit Zenodo/Git-LFS-tracked binaries
   without explicit instruction.

---

## 6. Fast inner loop: iterating on a single step from `call_*`

A completed run directory (e.g., `runs/p1_Pacific/`) contains a
`call_{case}` script (`.bat` on Windows, `.sh` on macOS/Linux) with every
step of the pipeline as a standalone, fully-parameterized command — each
preprocessing script, the
GAMS `a_createmodel.gms` invocation, every solve year, resource adequacy,
the report, etc. You can re-run any individual step in isolation against the
inputs/outputs the prior steps already wrote into the run folder. This is
much faster than a full rerun and is often the right first check while
iterating on a single file.

### When to use it

- You changed **one file** (or one pipeline stage's worth of files) and
  want to confirm the step still runs and to inspect what its outputs
  changed.
- Examples:
  - Edited a preprocessing script (`writecapdat.py`, `calc_financial_inputs.py`,
    …) → re-run that script's line, diff its outputs in `inputs_case/`.
  - Edited [`reeds/core/setup/b_inputs.gms`](reeds/core/setup/b_inputs.gms) or
    another file `$include`d by `a_createmodel.gms` → re-run the
    `gams reeds/core/setup/a_createmodel.gms` line; this surfaces compilation
    errors and parameter-load errors quickly without doing a solve.
  - Edited [`reeds/core/terminus/report.gms`](reeds/core/terminus/report.gms)
    or [`reeds/core/terminus/report_dump.py`](reeds/core/terminus/report_dump.py)
    → re-run those lines to check that reported outputs change as expected.
  - Edited a postprocessing script → re-run that script against the existing
    `outputs/` to check formatting/plots without re-solving.
  - Edited a solve file → re-run a single year (e.g., `reeds/core/solve/3_solve_oneyear.gms`).

### When *not* to use it

- The change spans **multiple pipeline stages** (e.g., a new CSV written by
  `writecapdat.py`, registered in
  [`reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv`](reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv),
  and loaded in `b_inputs.gms`). Running one step in isolation tests one
  half of the dependency; the other half still uses stale state. You can
  chain steps manually, but at that point a full Pacific rerun is safer
  and not much slower.
- The change interacts with feedback loops, e.g., resource adequacy outputs
  feeding the next solve year. Per-step testing tells you almost nothing
  about end-to-end behavior.
- The change is gated by a switch that the existing run did not exercise.
  Pick (or rerun) a case that does.
- Pure code-organization or comment-only changes — there's nothing to diff.

### Decision summary

| Scope of change | Right test |
| --- | --- |
| Single file, no new cross-step dependencies | Re-run that step from `call_*`, diff its outputs |
| Multiple files in the same pipeline stage | Re-run those steps in order, diff |
| Crosses pipeline stages (preprocessing ↔ GAMS, GAMS ↔ resource adequacy, GAMS ↔ report) | Full Pacific rerun + `compare_cases.py` |
| Interacts with switches not exercised by the existing run | Full rerun of a case that does exercise them |

The fast inner loop **complements** the testing tiers in §2.3 — it does not
replace them. Use it to catch problems early, then run the appropriate
full-case tier before opening a PR.

### Prerequisites and how to ask for them

1. **A completed run must already exist.** Check `runs/` first. If it is
   empty, there is nothing to diff against and the fast inner loop cannot
   be used. Either ask the user to run the Pacific test case first (a
   single ~20-minute investment that pays off across many iterations) or
   fall back to the full-case tier.
2. **If multiple runs exist, ask which to use.** Different folders may come
   from different branches, scenarios, or vintages. Each run's
   `meta.csv` records the branch and commit it was built from — use that to
   confirm with the user, do not guess.
3. **Watch out for the frozen-copy gotcha.** When `runreeds.py` sets up a
   run, it copies the `reeds/` source tree into the run folder. The
   `call_*` script invokes those copies, e.g.:
   ```
   python <repo>/runs/t1_Pacific/reeds/input_processing/writecapdat.py ...
   ```
   If you edited the source file in the repo (e.g.,
   `reeds/input_processing/writecapdat.py`), the rerun will silently use
   the stale frozen copy and show **no diff**. Either:
   - Copy your edited source file into the run folder before invoking, or
   - Invoke the source path explicitly with the same arguments.
   The same applies to GAMS files (`reeds/core/setup/b_inputs.gms`,
   `reeds/core/setup/a_createmodel.gms`,
   `reeds/core/terminus/report.gms`, etc.).

### Diffing outputs

- For Python preprocessing steps, snapshot the relevant `inputs_case/`
  files before re-running, then diff the new versions with pandas
  (row counts, summary stats, max abs/relative differences, regions or
  techs where values changed). Use
  [`reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv`](reeds/input_processing/runfiles.csv)
  to identify which files a given script writes.
- For GAMS steps, the standard pattern for inspecting intermediate state
  is to add
  ```gams
  execute_unload "temp.gdx" param1, param2, set1;
  ```
  at the point of interest, re-run the step, and read `temp.gdx` from
  Python (e.g., `gdxpds`) to compare against an unmodified-baseline gdx.
  **Always remove these `execute_unload` debug statements before
  committing** — they're easy to leave behind and add noise (and mild
  runtime cost) in production runs.
- For report / postprocessing steps, diff the resulting CSVs in
  `outputs/` (or the generated plots/pptx) against a baseline copy.

### What to report back to the user

- Which step you re-ran and the exact command (copied from `call_*`).
- Which output files changed, and a concise summary of the deltas.
- Whether the deltas are consistent with the intended change.
- An explicit reminder that this does not replace the §2.3 testing tier
  appropriate to the change.

## 7. Useful commands

```bash
# Activate environment (after one-time `conda env create -f environment.yml`)
conda activate reeds2

# Lightweight smoke tests (not a model-correctness suite)
pytest

# Lint Python (linter only — do not auto-format existing files)
ruff check

# Build docs locally
cd docs && make html   # output at docs/build/html/index.html

# Run a test case. runreeds.py is INTERACTIVE by default; pass -b and -c
# (and optionally -s and -f) for non-interactive use.
python runreeds.py                              # interactive prompts
python runreeds.py -b v20260101_dev -c test     # non-interactive, all cases in cases_test.csv
python runreeds.py -b v20260101_dev -c test -s Pacific   # single case
python runreeds.py -h                           # full flag list

# Download remote input files up front (optional)
python reeds/remote.py
```
